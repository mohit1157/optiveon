                <h3>Important Risk Warning</h3>
                <p>Trading in financial instruments, including futures, options, and forex, involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for all investors. You should carefully consider whether trading is appropriate for you in light of your financial condition. The high degree of leverage that is often obtainable in trading can work against you as well as for you. Past performance is not indicative of future results.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>1. General Risk Disclosure</h2>
            <p>The information and tools provided by Optiveon LLC ("Company," "we," "us," or "our") are intended for research and educational purposes only. Our services include market analysis tools, algorithmic research platforms, and signal generation systems designed to assist with market research.</p>

            <p><strong>Before using our services or making any investment decisions, you should understand the following:</strong></p>

            <h2>2. No Investment Advice</h2>
            <p>Optiveon LLC does not provide investment advice, financial advice, legal advice, or tax advice. Our services are not intended to be, and should not be construed as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any financial instrument</li>
                <li>An offer or solicitation to buy or sell securities</li>
                <li>Personalized investment advice based on your circumstances</li>
                <li>A substitute for professional financial advice</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Trading Risks</h2>

            <h3>3.1 Risk of Loss</h3>
            <p>Trading in futures, options, and forex markets carries a high level of risk and may not be suitable for all investors. There is a possibility that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment. You should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose.</p>

            <h3>3.2 Leverage Risk</h3>
            <p>The use of leverage in trading can magnify both gains and losses. While leverage can increase potential returns, it also significantly increases risk. A relatively small market movement can have a proportionately larger impact on the funds you have deposited or will have to deposit.</p>

            <h3>3.3 Market Risk</h3>
            <p>Financial markets are subject to various risks including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Market volatility and rapid price changes</li>
                <li>Liquidity risk, especially in less traded instruments</li>
                <li>Gap risk, where prices can move significantly between market closings and openings</li>
                <li>Regulatory changes that may affect market conditions</li>
                <li>Economic and political events that can cause sudden market movements</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3.4 Technology Risk</h3>
            <p>Electronic trading systems, including algorithmic trading tools, are subject to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>System failures, errors, or delays</li>
                <li>Data feed inaccuracies or interruptions</li>
                <li>Communication breakdowns</li>
                <li>Cyber security threats</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Signal Generation Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>Our signal generation tools are based on algorithmic analysis and historical data patterns. Important considerations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Past Performance:</strong> Historical performance and backtesting results do not guarantee future results</li>
                <li><strong>No Guarantees:</strong> We make no guarantees about the accuracy, reliability, or profitability of any signals</li>
                <li><strong>Hypothetical Results:</strong> Simulated or hypothetical trading does not reflect real market conditions and may be subject to biases</li>
                <li><strong>Independent Verification:</strong> You should independently verify any signal before making trading decisions</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Hypothetical Performance Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS HAVE MANY INHERENT LIMITATIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED BELOW:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown</li>
                <li>There are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and the actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading program</li>
                <li>Hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk, and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading</li>
                <li>The ability to withstand losses or adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading losses are material points which can also adversely affect actual trading results</li>
            </ul>
